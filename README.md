### Who is Solon:
> Solon was an Athenian statesman, lawmaker, and poet who lived in the 6th century BCE. He is best known for his political and economic reforms that helped lay the foundation for Athenian democracy. As archon (chief magistrate) around 594 BCE, he introduced laws that alleviated debt slavery, restructured the political system based on wealth rather than birth, and encouraged trade and industry. His reforms sought to balance the power between the aristocracy and common citizens, preventing social unrest. Though his changes were not immediately successful, they influenced the later development of democratic governance in Athens.
